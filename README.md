# PircBot2
A newer version of PIRC Bot with more modern capabilities.

Credit for the Original PIRC Bot goes to Jibble at http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php

This takes PIRC bot and makes it a little more modern. It fully gets rid of Vectors, which PIRC Bot relied on and replaces them with more reliable collections from the Collection Framework. I've also gotten rid of many "private final" methods, as well as made some selected methods public non-final.
